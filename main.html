		<h1 id="f1">Sunflower</h1>
		<p>The sunflower, on the other hand, is a striking and cheerful flower known for its large, bright yellow blooms that resemble the sun. Scientifically named Helianthus annuus and part of the Asteraceae family, sunflowers are native to North and Central America. They are unique for their heliotropic behavior, with young flowers turning to follow the sun throughout the day. Mature sunflowers, however, usually face east. Aside from their visual appeal, sunflowers are highly valued for their seeds, which are consumed as snacks, pressed for oil, or used in bird feed. Symbolically, sunflowers represent loyalty, longevity, and happiness, making them a popular choice for gifts and celebrations. Their ability to thrive in various climates and their ecological benefits as pollinator-friendly plants further enhance their importance in agriculture and gardening.</p>
